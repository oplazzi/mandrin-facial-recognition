\subsection{What's in a face?}
 In human-human interaction the visual communication channel, i.e. the body pose, gestures and especially the face, contributes immensly to the efficiency and quality of the communication. The exchange of pure verbal content  regularly leads to mis-interpretations and mis-understandings. Thus, for technical applications which want to analyse and improve human-human or human-computer communication, the analysis of the faces is needed. A human face itself provides various information about the person: The gender, age, ethnic origin, ametropia wearing glasses), beards, identity, plus the emotion (anger, joy, fear, sadness, etc\dots ). We can then deduce things like activity, interest level, positiveness, etc\dots
