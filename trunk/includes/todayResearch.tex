\IEEEPARstart{N}{owadays} searches look at facial features detection, and facial expression recognition. Indeed, for analyse a face there is several methods. The most used method is an 2D image processing method, but some searchers work on others methods like 3D images, images from IR sensor, material analysis. Searches move on but they are framed by hardware specifications. High definition images give a lot of possibilities like surface analysis. Lets see differents models currently in search.
