\IEEEPARstart{T}{o} conclude, we can say face recognation is expanding. We have got currently some systems which implement some simple features. We don't finished research in this area, we can see that in article \cite{lala}. This domain is a new way for interactive computing, that make available face interactions with computers. We can imagine invalid people wich can communicate with others across computer analysing her face. It's like fantasy books, systems can percept our emotions, so can analyse them. \\
One question come on our mind, twisted with other technologies like robot, and artificial intelligence system, is that giving to machins skills which will make them more and more humans?\\
