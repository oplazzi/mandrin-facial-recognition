Through his eyes, the human is capable of recognizing the identity of a person, as well as several other information in a very short time. Research on automation of this function goes back more than 30 years.

More recently face recognition has become a hot topic of modern day research as a result of the growing pressure to exploit faces as a means of identification from both the commercial and law enforcement sectors.
This is evidenced by the
increasing number of companies that are offering face recognition solutions and by the considerable
amount of new research that is being funded.

Now, facial recognition is not confined only to the identification of individuals as the fingerprint analysis. A new market is born. A market where our face becomes an additional HMI to communicate with our computers as we have done for years with our fingers tapping on our keyboards, clicking our mice, and recently by talking, touching our screens and moving our remotes.
