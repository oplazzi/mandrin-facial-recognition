More recently face recognition has become a hot topic of modern day research as a result of the growing pressure to exploit faces as a means of identification from both the commercial and law enforcement sectors.
This is evidenced by the
increasing number of companies that are offering face recognition solutions and by the considerable

Now, face analysis is not confined only to the identification of individuals as the fingerprint analysis. A new market is born. A market where our face becomes an additional HMI to communicate with our computers as we have done for years with our fingers tapping on our keyboards, clicking our mice, and recently by talking, touching our screens and moving our remotes.
We already can use face analysis tools, some softwares exist on our cell phones, computers, or game console.
But how does it work ? And what kind of uses that will give us ?

So, in the first part we explain what is the face analysis, continue with today methods in the second part. In the third part we speak about currently reasearchs and futur methods.
