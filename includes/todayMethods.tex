This technology would allow such computers to analyze the process of passersby (one heavily loaded adopts an unusual step, that he carries? explosives, weapons, a television camera, a small cat or soda bottles ?). Other recent research based on the predictability of human behavior in public spaces: A robber does not behave according to some, in the same way as a user. The computer can identify what kind of movements and raise the alarm. The idea would be, just like in the movie Minority Report (Steven Spielberg, 2002) to arrest the person before she commits a crime or misdemeanor.
Coupled to a biometric database would make it possible to determine the identity of a person without approaching it and without even realizing it. An experiment of this type took place in 2007 in a train station in Mainz, Germany, 60\% of volunteers were identified among a crowd of 20,000 people. This result is too low for implementation but these promoters say they can offer better results in 2012.
